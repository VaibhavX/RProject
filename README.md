R code based on the different input files.

Task that we are aiming to achieve:
1. Merge the multiple responses into a single large CSV files.
2. Creating a separate code for no responses and maybe checking the battery file for being one of the reasons. 
3. Creating a differnt identifier in the big merge file as to save the multiple responses properly.

--------

Update:

1. Code for merging the static dataset works. Quick note on using the code - Change the path to the directory where multiple CSV files are located.
[Currently being tested for dynamic dataset]
