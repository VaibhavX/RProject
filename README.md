R code based on the different input files.

Task that we are aiming to achieve:
1. Merge the multiple responses into a single large CSV files.
2. Converting the String responses to Likert Scale for analysis.
3. Creating a separate code for no responses and maybe checking the battery file for being one of the reasons. 
4. Working on the daily logs file (merge with files having different number of columns)

--------

Update:

1. Code for merging the static dataset works. Quick note on using the code - Change the path to the directory where multiple CSV files are located.
[Currently being tested for dynamic dataset]

2. Likert Scale Conversion code is done.
3. Testing the 2 data sources needs to be done. [Will take some time to write the code]
4. Work on the Daily Log files - similar to merging but with different number of columns.
